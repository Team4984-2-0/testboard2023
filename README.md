# testboard2023
Since physical Robot will not be available for a while Team4984 will use
  this testboard2023 as it's deployment and testing platform

Updated 1/8/23 with driverXbox and tankDriveCommand.
  ToDo1: connect the Xbox joysticks so they send values to the motors.
  ToDo2: Verify the TalonSRX motor numbers in DriveTrain.java
  ToDo3: If encoders are not on testboard you may need to comment them out
